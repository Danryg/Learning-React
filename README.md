# Learning-React
This repository's main purpose is to have all notes that I need for react native. This should include all the information you need to create a good and future proof react application.

I will divide up all the notes into different languages and go over certain principles that should be followed, since I haven't worked with react before, i am going to take notes on normal react first
 

Languages

	- NPM
	- Javascript
	- JSX

Prerequisites

	- Basic Javascript
	- Simple NPM basic knowledge
	- Object Oriented Programming theory

### Order
If you have very little prior knowledge into react development i recommend you start by quickly reading trough the [[Javascript - Intro]]  and [[NPM - Intro]]
