# Creating a project
Run the command in CMD

	expo init name

## Choosing workflow
The workflow is what files will be presented to you

### Managed workflow
Expo will take care of all the complexity behind the scene

### Bare workflow
We will have a bare bone react native project, this will allow you to go into specific Android or IOS features 

For this i will use the blank managed workflow
