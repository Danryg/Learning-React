# Rendering

Writing JSx code will create react elements but we need to render them into the ReactDOM that will render the component or element


### DOM
What is dom

### How to render

	imoport ReactDOM from "react-dom"

	const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
	ReactDOM.render(element, container);

To render the first object you usually use the root object as a container. To get the root object you use good old normal JavaScript

	document.getElementById('root')
